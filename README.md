# CatchBook

AI-powered fishing journal for kayak anglers.

## Vision

Make fishing data collection effortless so anglers can focus on fishing, not forms—while building the most intelligent fishing assistant on the market.

## Features (Planned)

- **Photo-based catch logging:** Snap a photo → AI handles the rest
- **Species identification:** Computer vision identifies fish species automatically
- **Auto-populated data:** EXIF location, weather, tides, solunar periods
- **Equipment tracking:** Track which lures work when/where
- **Predictive intelligence:** AI recommends optimal conditions and gear

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript
- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Mobile:** Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **AI:** Claude API for species identification

## Development Timeline

9-12 months (spans 28 phases of dev-curriculum)

## Development Workflow

This project follows a feature branch workflow:

- `main` — Production-ready code
- `feature/*` — New features under development
- `bugfix/*` — Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` — Critical production fixes

All features are developed on separate branches and merged to main via pull requests.
